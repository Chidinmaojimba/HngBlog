            <h2>Motivation for Becoming a Front-End Developer</h2>
            <p>
                From an early age, I’ve always been fascinated by technology, especially how websites and applications function and look. My desire to become a Front-End Developer stems from my passion for creating interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web pages. I find joy in turning concepts into digital experiences that users can engage with. Being a front-end developer means I get to work on the things that people directly interact with, and that is incredibly rewarding. Whether it's a website, a web app, or a mobile-friendly interface, I want to be the one who makes these designs come to life.
